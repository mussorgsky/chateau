Baby's first chat server/client thing, pretty bare bones and barely working

## Functionality:
- Send messages with your cool username written on them
- Have other people receive those messages

## Thing's we all wish this thing had:
- Different chat rooms
- Less ugly gray messages from other people, maybe some colors that the users could customize
- Smarter checking for new messages, like a request what wouldn't timeout for a long while and the server would respond right as a new message appears
- Save the messages and users somewhere so they don't disappear when the server shuts off. Or maybe that's a feature, snapchat is still cool?
